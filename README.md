# SeoulBikes



This case study explores possible regression models that can give accurate prediction as to how many rental bikes Seoul needs to have available to the city on an hourly basis. Many may agree that clear factors for the number of bikes rented would be temperature, rainfall, and even season. However, this may be agreed upon or refuted based on the real relationships within the data. The Seoul Bike Sharing Demand data set is used to analyse these factors and their efficacy towards predicting the number of bikes that must be available to rent at once.
